        <ul>
          <li><p>
            Dr. Richard Pattis developed Karel the Robot as a learning tool.

            Using the Snipe project as a starting point, Dean Sanders and
            Brian Dorn specified, designed, and implemented the first
            version of Jeroo. They are coninually revising and updating
            Jeroo to meet the needs of the growing community of users.

            Using the Jeroo project from 2002. Ben Konz, Calean Bryan,
            Thomas Connole, and John Adam have implemented the first version
            of a web based Jeroo. Ocaml was used to create the compiler. Angular
            was used for the web framework. Items added to the jeroo program
            are syntax highlighting, and jeroo board size editablity.
