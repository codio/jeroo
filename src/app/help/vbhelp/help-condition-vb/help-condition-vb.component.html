  <h1>Conditions (VB.NET Style)</h1>
  A condition is just a Boolean expression -- an expression that is either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.
  <ul>
    <li>Conditions are used to define selection and repetition control structures</li>
    <li>In Jeroo, a Boolean expression is any valid combination of Boolean operators
      and invocations of Boolean methods.</li>
    <li>There are two Boolean constants: <b>TRUE</b> and <b>FALSE</b></li>
    <li>There are three Boolean operators:
      <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier"><b>NOT</b>,
        <b> AND</b>, and <b>OR</b>.</font><br></li>
    <li>In the absence of parentheses to indicate otherwise,
      every NOT operator will be evaluated first,
      every AND operator will be evaluated second, and
      every OR operator will be evaluated third.</li>
  </ul>
