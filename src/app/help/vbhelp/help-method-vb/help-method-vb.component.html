    <h1>Methods (VB.NET Style)</h1>

    A Jeroo program must contain exactly one main method, and usually contains several user-defined Jeroo methods
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Main Method</h3>
    Every Jeroo program must have exactly one main method.
    <br>
    <br>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
                    <b>Sub main()</b><br>
                    <pre>    '-- declare and instantiate all Jeroos

   '-- use the Jeroos to solve the problem
                    </pre>
                    <b>End Sub</b>
                </font>
    </table>
    <ul>
        <li> All Jeroos must be declared and instantiated at the
            beginning of the main method.
            <li> The rest of the main method is used to direct the actions of the
                Jeroos by sending them messages to execute predefined or
                user-defined methods.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>User-Defined Jeroo Methods</h3>
    A Jeroo program can have any number of user-defined Jeroo methods.
    <br>
    <br>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
                    <b>Sub</b> <i>identifier</i><b> ()</b><br>
                    <pre>    '-- body of the method
                    </pre>
                    <b>End Sub</b>
                </font>
    </table>
    <ul>
        <li> A user-defined method extends the capabilites of every Jeroo.
            <li> The source code in a user-defined Jeroo method must invoke a
                method directly, instead of sending a message to a specific Jeroo.
                <li> A user-defined Jeroo method can invoke other user-defined Jeroo
                    methods, even itself (recursion).
                    <li> User-defined Jeroo methods can appear in any order in the source code.
    </ul>
