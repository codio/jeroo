  <h1>Methods (VB.NET Style)</h1>

  A Jeroo program must contain exactly one main method, and usually contains several user-defined Jeroo methods
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Main Method</h3>
  Every Jeroo program must have exactly one main method.
  <br>
  <br>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
          <b>Sub main()</b><br>
          <pre>    '-- declare and instantiate all Jeroos

   '-- use the Jeroos to solve the problem
          </pre>
          <b>End Sub</b>
        </font>
  </table>
  <ul>
    <li> All Jeroos must be declared and instantiated at the
      beginning of the main method.</li>
    <li> The rest of the main method is used to direct the actions of the
      Jeroos by sending them messages to execute predefined or
      user-defined methods.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>User-Defined Jeroo Methods</h3>
  A Jeroo program can have any number of user-defined Jeroo methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
          <b>Sub</b> <i> identifier</i><b> ()</b><br>
          <pre>    '-- body of the method
          </pre>
          <b>End Sub</b>
        </font>
  </table>
  <ul>
    <li> A user-defined method extends the capabilites of every Jeroo.</li>
    <li> The source code in a user-defined Jeroo method must invoke a
      method directly, instead of sending a message to a specific Jeroo.</li>
    <li> A user-defined Jeroo method can invoke other user-defined Jeroo
      methods, even itself (recursion).</li>
    <li> User-defined Jeroo methods can appear in any order in the source code.</li>
  </ul>
