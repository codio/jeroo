  <h1>Control Structures (Python Style)</h1>

  A control structure determines the order in which statements will be executed. In addition to sequential execution, the Jeroo language supports four control structures
  <ul>
    <li> if</li>
    <li> if-else</li>
    <li> cascaded if (a variation on if-else)</li>
    <li> pretest while</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>The<i> if </i>Structure</h3>
  The <i>if</i> structure is used to define an optional block of code.
  <br>
  <br>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
          <b>if</b><i> condition</i> <b>:</b><br>
          <br>
          <pre>    #-- true block (indented)  </pre>
          <br>
          <pre>#-- next statement (not indented)</pre>
        </font>
  </table>

  <ul>
    <li> If the condition is true, execute the "true block " exactly once,<br>
      and continue with the "next statement".</li>
    <li> If the condition is false, skip the "true block", <br>
      and resume execution with the "next statement".</li>
    <li> Do not go back and recheck the condition.</li>
    <li> <b>SYNTAX NOTES:</b> <br></li>
    <ul>
      <li> The first line of the "true block" must be indented further than the <b>if</b>.</li>
      <li> The "true block" includes all lines that are indented
        at least as far as the first line of the block.</li>
      <li> The "next statement" should be indented exactly as far as the <b>if</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>The<i> if-else</i> Structure</h3>
  The <i>if-else</i> structure is used to define alternate blocks of code. <br>
  Only one of the blocks will be executed.
  <br>
  <br>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
          <b>if</b><i> condition</i> <b>:</b><br>
          <br>
          <pre>    #-- true block (indented)  </pre>
          <br>
          <b>else:</b><br>
          <br>
          <pre>    #-- false block (indented)  </pre>
          <br>
          <pre>#-- next statement (not indented)</pre>
        </font>
  </table>

  <ul>
    <li> If the condition is true, execute the "true block " exactly once, <br>
      and resume execution with the "next statement".</li>
    <li> If the condition is false, execute the "false block" exactly once,<br>
      and resume execution with the "next statement".</li>
    <li> Do not go back and recheck the condition.</li>
    <li> <b>SYNTAX NOTES:</b> <br></li>
    <ul>
      <li> The first line of the "true block" must be indented further than the <b>if</b>.</li>
      <li> The "true block" includes all lines that are indented
        at least as far as the first line of the block.</li>
      <li> The <b>else:</b> should be indented exactly as far as the <b>if</b>.</li>
      <li> The first line of the "false block" must be indented further
        than the <b>else</b>.</li>
      <li> The "false block" includes all lines that are indented
        at least as far as the first line of the block.</li>
      <li> The "next statement" should be indented exactly as far as the <b>if</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>The <i>cascaded if</i> Structure</h3>
  The <i>cascaded if</i> is a variation on the if-else structure. <br>
  The <i>cascaded if</i> is used to define three or more blocks of code. <br>
  Only one of the blocks will be executed.
  <br>
  <br>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
          <b>if</b><i> condition-0</i> <b>:</b> <br>
          <br>
          <pre>    #-- block-0  (indented) </pre>
          <br>
          <b>elif</b><i> condition-1</i> <b>:</b> <br>
          <br>
          <pre>    #-- block-1 (indented)  </pre>
          <br><br>
          #-- other elif blocks go here<br>
          <br>
          <br><br>
          <b>elif</b><i> condition-n</i> <b>:</b> <br>
          <br>
          <pre>    #-- block-n (indented)  </pre>
          <br>
          <b>else:</b><br>
          <br>
          <pre>    #-- default block (indented)  </pre>
          <br>


          <pre>#-- next statement</pre>
        </font>
  </table>

  <ul>
    <li> Jeroo checks the conditions in the order that they appear.</li>
    <li> When the first true condition is located, the corresponding block will be executed,
      and all other blocks and conditions will be skipped.</li>
    <li> If all conditions are false, the default block will be executed.</li>
    <li> After any block has been executed, execution resumes with the "next statement".</li>
    <li> <b>SYNTAX NOTES:</b> <br></li>
    <ul>
      <li> The first line of each block must be indented further than the <b>if</b>,
        <b>else</b>, or <b>elif</b> at the start of that block.</li>
      <li> Each block includes all lines that are indented
        at least as far as the first line of the block.</li>
      <li> The <b>elif</b> and <b>else</b> lines should be indented exactly as far
        as the <b>if</b>.</li>
      <li> The "next statement" should be indented exactly as far as the <b>if</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>The<i> pretest while </i>Structure</h3>
  The <i>pretest while</i> structure (also called a while loop) is used to define a block of code that will be executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
  <br>
  <br>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
          <b>while</b><i> condition</i> <b>:</b><br>
          <br>
          <pre>    #-- loop body (indented)  </pre>
          <br>
          <pre>#-- next statement</pre>
        </font>
  </table>

  <ul>
    <li> When the condition is true, execute the "loop body " once,<br>
      then go back and reevaluate the condition.</li>
    <li> When the condition is false, skip the "loop body", <br>
      and resume execution with the "next statement".</li>
    <li> <b>SYNTAX NOTES:</b> <br></li>
    <ul>
      <li> The first line of the loop body must be indented further than the <b>while</b>.</li>
      <li> The loop body includes all lines that are indented
        at least as far as the first line of the body.</li>
      <li> The "next statement" should be indented exactly as far as the <b>while</b>.</li>
    </ul>

  </ul>
</div>
