    <h1>Control Structures (Python Style)</h1>

    A control structure determines the order in which statements will be executed. In addition to sequential execution, the Jeroo language supports four control structures
    <ul>
        <li> if
            <li> if-else
                <li> cascaded if (a variation on if-else)
                    <li> pretest while
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>The<i> if </i>Structure</h3>
    The <i>if</i> structure is used to define an optional block of code.
    <br>
    <br>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
                    <b>if</b> <i>condition</i> <b>:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <pre>    #-- true block (indented)  </pre>
                    <br>
                    <pre>#-- next statement (not indented)</pre>
                </font>
    </table>

    <ul>
        <li> If the condition is true, execute the "true block " exactly once,<br>
            and continue with the "next statement".
            <li> If the condition is false, skip the "true block", <br>
                and resume execution with the "next statement".
                <li> Do not go back and recheck the condition.
                    <li> <b>SYNTAX NOTES:</b> <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> The first line of the "true block" must be indented further than the <b>if</b>.
                                <li> The "true block" includes all lines that are indented
                                    at least as far as the first line of the block.
                                    <li> The "next statement" should be indented exactly as far as the <b>if</b>.
                        </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>The<i> if-else</i> Structure</h3>
    The <i>if-else</i> structure is used to define alternate blocks of code. <br>
    Only one of the blocks will be executed.
    <br>
    <br>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">

                    <br>
                    <pre>    #-- true block (indented)  </pre>
                    <br>
                    <b>else:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <pre>    #-- false block (indented)  </pre>
                    <br>
                    <pre>#-- next statement (not indented)</pre>
                </font>
    </table>

    <ul>
        <li> If the condition is true, execute the "true block " exactly once, <br>
            and resume execution with the "next statement".
            <li> If the condition is false, execute the "false block" exactly once,<br>
                and resume execution with the "next statement".
                <li> Do not go back and recheck the condition.
                    <li> <b>SYNTAX NOTES:</b> <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> The first line of the "true block" must be indented further than the <b>if</b>.
                                <li> The "true block" includes all lines that are indented
                                    at least as far as the first line of the block.
                                    <li> The <b>else:</b> should be indented exactly as far as the <b>if</b>.
                                        <li> The first line of the "false block" must be indented further
                                            than the <b>else</b>.
                                            <li> The "false block" includes all lines that are indented
                                                at least as far as the first line of the block.
                                                <li> The "next statement" should be indented exactly as far as the <b>if</b>.
                        </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>The <i>cascaded if</i> Structure</h3>
    The <i>cascaded if</i> is a variation on the if-else structure. <br>
    The <i>cascaded if</i> is used to define three or more blocks of code. <br>
    Only one of the blocks will be executed.
    <br>
    <br>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>

    <ul>
        <li> Jeroo checks the conditions in the order that they appear.
            <li> When the first true condition is located, the corresponding block will be executed,
                and all other blocks and conditions will be skipped.
                <li> If all conditions are false, the default block will be executed.
                    <li> After any block has been executed, execution resumes with the "next statement".

                                <li> The first line of each block must be indented further than the <b>if</b>,
                                    <b>else</b>, or <b>elif</b> at the start of that block.
                                    <li> Each block includes all lines that are indented
                                        at least as far as the first line of the block.
                                        <li> The <b>elif</b> and <b>else</b> lines should be indented exactly as far
                                            as the <b>if</b>.
                                            <li> The "next statement" should be indented exactly as far as the <b>if</b>.

    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>The<i> pretest while </i>Structure</h3>
    The <i>pretest while</i> structure (also called a while loop) is used to define a block of code that will be executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
    <br>
    <br>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
            <td>

            then go back and reevaluate the condition.
            <li> When the condition is false, skip the "loop body", <br>
                and resume execution with the "next statement".

                            <li> The loop body includes all lines that are indented
                                at least as far as the first line of the body.
