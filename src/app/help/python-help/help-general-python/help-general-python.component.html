<h3>Whitespace</h3>
Whitespace consists of blank spaces and blank lines. These should be used to help a reader understand the logical organization of the source code.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Comments</h3>
Comments are used to provide information to a person who is reading the source code.
<ul>
    <li>Every comment begins with the number character (#), and continues
