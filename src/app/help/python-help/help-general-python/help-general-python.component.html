    <li>identifiers</li>
    <li>indentation blocks</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Whitespace</h3>
  Whitespace consists of blank spaces and blank lines. These should be used to help a reader understand the logical organization of the source code.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Comments</h3>
  Comments are used to provide information to a person who is reading the source code.
  <ul>
    <li>Every comment begins with the number character (#), and continues</li>
    to the end of the line.
    <li>A comment can appear at the end of a statement,
      or on a separate line.</li>
    <li>Comments are ignored by the compiler.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Identifiers</h3>
  An identifier is a name that a programmer creates for a Jeroo or a method.
  <ul>
    <li> An identifier must begin with a letter or an underscore</li>

  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
