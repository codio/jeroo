  <h1>Methods (Python Style)</h1>

  A Jeroo program must contain a main section, and usually contains several user-defined Jeroo methods
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Main Section</h3>
  Every Jeroo program must include a main section. Code for the main section is written in the <b><i>main</i></b> tab of the editor, and must have the following form.
  <br>
  <br>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
          <br>
          <pre>#-- declare and instantiate all Jeroos

#-- use the Jeroos to solve the problem
          </pre>
        </font>
  </table>
  <ul>
    <li> All Jeroos must be declared and instantiated at the
      beginning of the main section.</li>
    <li> The rest of the main section is used to direct the actions of the
      Jeroos by sending them messages to execute predefined or
      user-defined methods.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>User-Defined Jeroo Methods</h3>
  A Jeroo program can have any number of user-defined Jeroo methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
          <b>def</b> <i> identifier</i><b>(self):</b><br>
          <br>
          <pre>    #-- body of the method (indented)
          </pre>
        </font>
  </table>
  <ul>
    <li> A user-defined method extends the capabilites of every Jeroo.</li>
    <li> The source code in a user-defined Jeroo method must invoke a
      method directly, instead of sending a message to a specific Jeroo.
      For example, <b>hop()</b> instead of <b>jessica.hop()</b>.</li>
    <li> A user-defined Jeroo method can invoke other user-defined Jeroo
      methods. It can even invoke itself; this is called <i>recursion</i>.</li>
    <li> User-defined Jeroo methods can appear in any order in the source code.</li>
    <li> <b>SYNTAX NOTE:</b> <br></li>
    <ul>
      <li> The first line of the body must be indented further than <b>def</b>.</li>
      <li> The body includes all lines that are indented
        at least as far as the first line of the body.</li>
      <li> The "next statement" should be indented exactly as far as <b>def</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</div>
