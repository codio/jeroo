<h1>Methods (Python Style)</h1>

A Jeroo program must contain a main section, and usually contains several user-defined Jeroo methods
<br>
<br>
<h3>Main Section</h3>
Every Jeroo program must include a main section. Code for the main section is written in the <b><i>main</i></b> tab of the editor, and must have the following form.
<br>
<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
                <br>
                <pre>#-- declare and instantiate all Jeroos

#-- use the Jeroos to solve the problem
</pre>
            </font>
</table>
<ul>
    <li> All Jeroos must be declared and instantiated at the
        beginning of the main section.
    <li> The rest of the main section is used to direct the actions of the
        Jeroos by sending them messages to execute predefined or
        user-defined methods.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>User-Defined Jeroo Methods</h3>
A Jeroo program can have any number of user-defined Jeroo methods.
<br>
<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier">
                <b>def</b> <i>identifier</i><b>(self):</b><br>
                <br>
                <pre>    #-- body of the method (indented)
</pre>
            </font>
</table>
<ul>
    <li> A user-defined method extends the capabilites of every Jeroo.
    <li> The source code in a user-defined Jeroo method must invoke a
        method directly, instead of sending a message to a specific Jeroo.
        For example, <b>hop()</b> instead of <b>jessica.hop()</b>.
    <li> A user-defined Jeroo method can invoke other user-defined Jeroo
        methods. It can even invoke itself; this is called <i>recursion</i>.
    <li> User-defined Jeroo methods can appear in any order in the source code.
    <li> <b>SYNTAX NOTE:</b> <br>
        <ul>
            <li> The first line of the body must be indented further than <b>def</b>.
            <li> The body includes all lines that are indented
                at least as far as the first line of the body.
            <li> The "next statement" should be indented exactly as far as <b>def</b>.
        </ul>
</ul>
