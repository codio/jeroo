  <h1>Conditions (Java/C++/C# Style)</h1>

  A condition is just a Boolean expression -- an expression that is either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.
  <ul>
    <li>Conditions are used to define selection and repetition control structures
      <li>In Jeroo, a Boolean expression is any valid combination of Boolean constants, operators
        and invocations of Boolean methods.</li>
      <li>There are two Boolean constants: <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>
        <li>There are three Boolean operators:
          <font size="3" color="#000000" face="courier"><b>!, &&, ||</b></font><br>
          These operators represent "not", "and", and "or", respectively.</li>
        <li>In the absence of parentheses to indicate otherwise,
          every "not" operator will be evaluated first,
          every "and" operator will be evaluated second, and
          every "or" operator will be evaluated third.</li>
  </ul>
